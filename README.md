# Arthurs-Nightmare

You have 3 lives to escape Arthur's house. But first, you need to collect 10 Woogles, and Arthur is out there to kill you.

Click on an adjacent room to move into it. You can also click on the same room you are in. However, whenever you move (or stay), Arthur has a chance to move too...

If you and Arthur pass by each other when moving, the game will pause for a second and let you know that you passed. However, Arthur knows too and he is going back to the room...

However, if you move into Arthur's room, or if you are ever in the same room with him, you lose a life. You have 3 lives. If you lose all 3, you die.

The good news it that you have a Detector which tells you Arthur's exact location. However, the Detector has finite uses.

Now, what about the Woogles? Well, press 1 to search one place in the room that you're in. Press 2 to search 2 places. However, for each place you check, your noise level increases. The more noise you make, the more likely that Arthur will hear you...

So what happens when you have all 10 Woogles? You have to escape. You escape by going to the Garage, Entrance or Indoor Garden, then clicking on your current room. If you do, you escape. If not, well then that's too bad...
